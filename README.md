## Overview
This project is a fully functional front-end website for the Sierra Leone Football Agency, developed as part of the Faculty of Information & Communications Technology Semester 3 Assignment/Project Brief (September 2025 to February 2026). The website is built using HTML, CSS, and optional JavaScript, ensuring it is responsive, user-friendly, and well-designed. It includes all required pages: Home, Players, Matches, About Us, and Contact.

The site promotes Sierra Leone football talents, featuring player profiles with images, age, position, and club history; match fixtures and results; agency details including vision, mission, and staff; and a contact form for inquiries.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout using CSS media queries, ensuring compatibility across devices (tested on desktops, tablets, and phones).
- **Navigation**: Consistent top navigation bar with links to all pages.
- **Home Page**: Banners, news announcements with a simple JavaScript-animated news ticker for interactivity.
- **Players Page**: Profiles displayed in a flexible layout with placeholder images (from Unsplash; can be replaced with real images).
- **Matches Page**: Table for fixtures and results.
- **About Us Page**: Sections for agency details, vision, mission, and staff/team list.
- **Contact Page**: Functional form (static; no backend submission) with contact details.
- **Theme**: Football-inspired colors (greens and whites) for visual appeal.
- **Optional JavaScript**: Basic script for page load and animation on the home page.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with media queries for responsiveness)
- JavaScript (optional for minor interactivity)

No external frameworks or libraries were used to keep it lightweight and compliant with assignment guidelines.
